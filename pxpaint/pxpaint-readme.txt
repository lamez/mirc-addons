The PxPaint addon allows users to draw whatever they like in a
provided window. There are numerous functions available for you
to use on the right side of the PxPaint window. Also on the 
right side of the PxPaint window is a window with the available
colours. 

It shouldn't interefere with anything on your script, and should
be able to fully function with ProjectX Addons.

-----[ ProjectX ]-----------------------------------------------

ProjectX is a Scripters Crew that focuses on creating scripts,
mainly mIRC-scripts. Not just one kind of script but all-kinds.
We create Practical Scripts for the lazy IRC-user, Protection
Scripts for the threatend one, Warscripts for the aggressive or
vengeance-seeking among us.

We are an organised group of scripters determined to help each
other create, develop and refine scripts. We bundle our 
knowledge, so that the inexperienced scripters may benefit from
our experienced crew-members and our experienced crew-members
benefit from the enthousiasm and fresh insights from our
less-experienced members. We are not trying to create the
'ULTIMATE' script, there is no such thing. We concentrate on
creating good, reliable, compatible and useful scripts for mIRC
users.

You can contact ProjectX in the following ways:
- Visit our homepage..: http://www.projectx.mx.dk/
- Vist us on IRC......: #projectx (Galaxynet)
