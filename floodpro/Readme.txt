Flood Protection v1 by datalogik (datalogik@theshell.org)

This will allow you to protect yourself against various
arrays of flooding, eg: joins, text, notices, etc... and
handle them with the utmost of ease.

  I. Installation

     1. Unzip all of your files into mirc's directory or a
        directory of your choice. (Most of mIRC's adddons
        require you to do this, I do not)

     2. Load the main mrc file, flood.mrc. This will then
        load the rest of the needed files and install all
        the correct variables.

     3. Go through the settings and configure a channel to
        be added. Popups are located in the menubar and the
        channel popups list.

 II. Setting up your Channel list

     1. The flood protection settings dialog is an easy way
        to add channels to the main list. Using this is as
        easy as 1-2-3. Open the settings dialog and click
        "Add", this will then open another dialog box that
        gives you options of "Channel, Punishment, and Protection
        Level." You should enter your channel and select the
        options that you choose.

     2. The flood protection edit fields will only allow you 
        to enter a number of 1-99, so be leanient and patient
        if it does not let you enter anything higher.

     3. The "* for" event is used to show what will happen if
        the user floods you. Eg: "10 Joins in 7 Seconds, 'Ban'
        for 1 minutes."

     4. Now the bantype must be set in order for the punishment
        of kick/ban to work. If it is not, it will not ban properly.
        The bantype is a large list of banned masks that will show
        up in the channel.

     5. There you have it, You have successfully added a channel
        to your main flood protection list. :D

III. Configuring your Messages

     1. To configure your messages, you must first open them. In
        order to do so, either type "/protection.messages" which
        is quite long or go through your menu/channel popups.

     2. Once you have done that, it will pop up a dialog with two
        combo fields, the first one will show the event and the
        second one will show your insert types: Seconds or Event.
        Eg: Seconds would mean <joinsecs> and Even would mean
        <joins>.

     3. Once you have done that, and edited your messages as you
        choose, hit the "Ok" button. 

 IV. Adding and Removing Channels

     1. A nifty little option to add a channel to your list is in
        the menu/channel popups. By clicking the "Add" option, you
        will add a channel and make the settings dialog pop up along
        with the "Add/Edit" channels dialog. This will add the active
        channel that you are in. Configure as you wish.

     2. Yet, As said above, a nifty little option to remove a channel 
        is built into your menu/channel popups. This will add the
        active channel that you are in.
